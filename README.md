# Julia Source Code

This repository contains my experiments with the Julia programming language
in October 2020.

## 1.jl

Some code I copied from somewhere that uses the JuMP and ClpSolver.

## 2.jl

Some code I copied from somewhere that uses the JuMP and Cbc.Optimizer.

## 3.jl

Simple "Hello world" program.

## 4.jl

An example that reads a .csv file.

## 5.jl

An example of using TextAnalysis.jl.

## 6.jl

An example that reads a color jpg from the Internet and writes it locally.

## 7.jl

Do what 6.jl does PLUS convert the color image to numbers and manipulate
the numbers.

## edge.jl

Reading an image file and using a quick edge mask to detect edges.

## crop.jl

Read an image. Read its size. Crop the image. Show the original and cropped images.

## tmp.jl

Similar to 1.jl.
